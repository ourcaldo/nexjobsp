Then, before we implement to generate the sitemap in this project, but right now the cms that handle it, so we request the sitemap to the API https://cms.nexjob.tech/api/v1/sitemaps read the documentation again, the API will give response like this (pasted).

Then you need to do this:

Make sure we served the sitemap from cms, not generate by ourself, just use proxy or similar approach that can served the sitemap from cms
Before we served, we need to change the host of sitemap. So, the sitemap will use loc like this "<loc>https://cms.nexjob.tech/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-pages.xml</loc>" I need you to change the host into the domain of NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URLand the sitemap format is NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL/sitemap.xml (for the root), NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL/sitemap-pages (for the pages), NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL/sitemap-post (for the post), and NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL/sitemap-job (for the job) and for the chunked version of blog and job is almost same, just add index references like /sitemap-post-12.xml.
Related to chunck version, if the sitemap response add a references like this:
{
"type": "job",
"url": "https://cms.nexjob.tech/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-job.xml",
"index": "https://cms.nexjob.tech/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-job.xml",
"references": [
"https://cms.nexjob.tech/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-job-1.xml"
]
}
That's mean the sitemap is chuncked version that placed under the index, so index > references. And inside the references sitemap is something like this "https://nexjob.tech/api/v1/sitemaps/sitemap-job-1.xml" you need to change the structure to "https://nexjob.tech/sitemaps/sitemap-job-1.xml" and the inside it will be have the job listing sitemap (chuncked) https://nexjob.tech/jobs/category-1/demo-job/ (this is already set like this, so this correct already)

So, basicly for the sitemap you didn't need to generate again, just need to get, change the structure and served.

Please deep dive into what i said, the api documentation and start to implement it
